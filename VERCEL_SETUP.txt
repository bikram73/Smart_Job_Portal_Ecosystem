  VERCEL FULL-STACK DEPLOYMENT SETUP
========================================

Your project is now configured to deploy BOTH frontend and backend on Vercel!

WHAT'S CONFIGURED:
✅ Frontend (React) - Static site
✅ Backend (Express API) - Serverless functions  
✅ Database (SQLite) - Auto-seeding
✅ All API routes working

NEXT STEPS:

1. GO TO VERCEL
   → Visit: https://vercel.com
   → Sign in with GitHub

2. IMPORT PROJECT
   → Click "New Project"
   → Select "Smart_Job_Portal_Ecosystem" repo
   → Vercel will auto-detect configuration

3. ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   → Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   → Add these:
   
   JWT_SECRET = your_secret_key_12345
   NODE_ENV = production

4. DEPLOY
   → Click "Deploy"
   → Wait 2-3 minutes
   → Done!

5. TEST
   → Visit your Vercel URL
   → Register a new account
   → Should work perfectly!

========================================

IMPORTANT NOTES:

⚠️ Database Limitation:
   SQLite resets on each deployment
   For production, use Vercel Postgres
   (See VERCEL_DEPLOY.md for migration)

✅ What Works:
   - User registration
   - Login
   - Job browsing (auto-seeded)
   - Applications
   - All features!

✅ No Extra Services Needed:
   - Everything runs on Vercel
   - No Railway, Render, or Heroku needed
   - Single deployment, single platform

========================================

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If registration still fails:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test /api/health endpoint
4. Check browser console for errors

See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for more help.
